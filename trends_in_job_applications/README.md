## Overview

The goal of this analysis is to identify trends in job application behaviors across people who are currently employed by an organization, self-employed, or unemployed and looking for work.
This will be done by analyzing actions that influence employment status.
The data used for this analysis comes from a survey of 52 participants asking questions about basic demographics, employment status, and a range of job searching behaviors.

The responses for each survey question are either categorical (which of the following options most applies to you) or numerical (on a scale of 1-10, how much to you agree with this statement).
For categorical questions, the proportions of people who answered each response were analyzed across the different employment statuses.
For numerical questions, the distributions of rankings were tracked.

The resulting data was analyzed for significant differences in either proportions or distributions of answers for groups of people with different employment statuses.
The questions with the most differences between employment statuses are discussed further in the “Results and Discussion” section.
