### Most Significant Results

#### Job Search Method
![Job Search Method](images/Job%20Search%20Method.png)

There is a noticable difference in the methods used to search for jobs between the differnet employment status groups.
Navigating company websites/career pages and employee referrals are the most common among employed individuals.
There are no entries for "Employee Referrals" in the self-employed or unelployed categories. This is expected given the nature of this method.
Self-employed people focus more on netowrking events, such as job fairs, and freelance platoforms, indicating that these methods are more useful for self employment than traditional employment.
While using company websites is a common search method for both employed and unemployed people, in the unemployed category it is outclassed largely by social media platforms and online job boards.
This could imply that navigating company websites and employee referrals are more useful for people who are already employed, however the aformentioned methods are much less frequent in the employed category.
It is also plausible that using company websites or seeking emplloyee referrals are more likely to lead to a job than using social media or onine job boards.

#### Application Submission Method
![Application Submission Method](images/Application%20Submission%20Method.png)

Online job applications make up a significant portion of submission methods for all groups.
Notably, submissions through recruitment agency websites are only present for self-employed people.
Submitting applications through postal mail is by far the most common method for unemployed individuals, while employed individuals prefer in person delivery or sending emails directly to hiring managers or HR departments.
This indicates that online applications are universally popular due to their convience.
Delivering applications in person and emailing hiring teams are more effective methods likely due to their personal nature.

#### Application Follow-Up Frequency
![Application Follow-Up Frequency](images/Application%20Follow-Up%20Frequency.png)

All groups of people have a significant portion that report as sometimes following up on job applications.
This is to be expected as most people likely don't make the conscious decision to always or never follow up on their applications.
Over half of people in the unemployed group report that they ofter or always follow up on applications, while the majority of employed people report never or rarely following up.
There are a couple explanations for this, the people who are employed likely have larger skill sets, so they may recieve follow up communication from companies more frequently, making it not necessary for them to follow up themselves. The other possibility is that people who cast a wider net, that is they spend thier time sending out more applications as opposed to following up on existing applications, are creating more opportunities to potentially land a job, which is why they are more likely to be employed.

#### Top Job Criterion
![Top Job Criterion](images/Top%20Job%20Criterion.png)

Interestingly, the top criteria when searching for a job are differnet for each employment status group.
The most common criteria for employed people are the job location and qualifications. The top criteris for people in the unemployed group are the job title and opportunity for career advancement. This difference in search behaviors is likely caused by the employed group having a job to begin with, and is not an indicator of behaviors that influence whether someone can get a job.
Thye common thread between top criteria for employed group is convienence. This makes sense, given the security of having a job, people can be more picky with their choices. For unemployed people, the top criteria imply that they tend to be more concerned with career growth.
Company reputation and work schedule/flecibility are the next top criteria for both employed and unemployed people, but not self-employed people. This makes sense given that self-employed people aren't considering the factor given that they are not working directly with a company. The top criteria for self-employed people are the job salary and benefits, and application deadline. This implies that people in the group are more pragmatic when it comes to choosing a job.
